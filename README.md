ZXETRIS

This is my second ZX Spectrum 48K game... This time I used the colors and not only old stile green as my previous MARTIAN WAR.
The game is a tetris like game, but with a little option called... CHAOS!
If you play with chaos mode the screen randomally change its orientation and you must recalibrate your playing way.
